In the main study, there were a total of 15 participants. We computed the NASA- Task Load Index for each condition, employing a five-point scale ranging from Very Low to Very High and from Perfect to Failure. The results are shown in Table 1, demonstrating that SciCapenter significantly reduced cognitive load for users. With the assistance of SciCapenter, users experienced reduced effort, frustration, and mental demand when composing captions. This effect was more pronounced under time constraints, with the overall NASA Task Index (Table 1) dropping from 2.93 to 2.16, compared to a smaller reduction from 2.39 to 2.04 in free writing. Additionally, the de- crease in frustration was the most significant, with the workload falling from 2.33 to 1.40 in free writing, and from 2.73 to 1.67 in time-limited scenarios.",

Readers comprehend and recall the un- derlying information significantly better when reading charts with captions, as compared with reading charts alone [2, 13, 30, 40]. Un- fortunately, authors do not pay needed attention to crafting figure captions in their papers. A recent study showed that over half of the figure captions in arXiv papers were rated as not helpful by Ph.D. students [19]. Meanwhile, with advances in deep learning, com- putational models now have a rich set of capabilities surrounding scientific figures: generating captions of decent quality [24, 37, 49], analyzing the information in figure images [6, 26, 35], and evaluat- ing the usefulness of figure captions [18]. However, literature has little to say about how these technologies could be used to help academics who write figure captions for their papers. The user stud- ies of these technologies were almost all conducted from a reader perspective, i.e., having participants read the machine-generated outputs and judge their quality [19, 51, 52]. The user needs of writ- ers and readers are known to be different [3, 8, 14, 44]; a piece of machine-generated text might be of lower readability but could serve as a useful draft for writers to work off of [9, 10, 28]. A few prior works, such as Intentable [5], InkSight [33], and AutoTitle [34], built systems that generate captions considering writers’ intentions and allow authors to refine visualization captions and titles, but they did not focus on composing figure captions for scholarly articles. This paper introduces SciCapenter, a system that puts together a set of cutting-edge AI technologies surrounding scientific figures to help users write figure captions in scholarly articles (Figure 1). Users first upload the PDF file of their working draft to SciCapen- ter, which will automatically extract all the figures and their cur- rent captions. Users can then browse and pinpoint figures they wish to modify.

We asked participants to rate the overall SciCapenter in terms of the following three questions on a five-point Likert scale: (i) How difficult is it to use the system? (Rating scale: Very Easy to Very Difficult), (ii) How useful is the system in assisting with caption writing? (Overall) (Rating scale: Very Bad to Very Good), and (iii) How fast is the system response? (Rating scale: Very Slow to Very Fast). Six more questions about the satisfaction level (a five-point Likert scale from Very Bad to Very Good) toward the six components (i.e., check table, caption rating, explanation for the rating, long caption, short caption, and referred paragraph) were also asked. Figure 3 shows the results. Overall, participants expressed high satisfaction with our sys- tem’s usability (average rating = 3.80, SD = 0.86, n = 15) and its ease of use (average rating = 1.80, SD = 0.68, n = 15). The response time got an average rating of 3.40 and was not considered too slow. We also discovered that, within SciCapenter, participants found machine-generated ratings and predictions more useful than machine-generated captions. Even extracted paragraphs that men- tioned the figure were deemed more helpful. Both long and short captions had the lowest average preference rating. Analyzing the",

We then manually redacted the captions from these selected papers using Adobe Acrobat Pro (Figure 2). All these ma- terials were prepared before the user study.

Once the PDF file is processed, the extracted figures are displayed on the navigation bar (Figure 1.B). Users can click on a figure to access the detailed information. Upon clicking, the selected figure (Fig- ure 1.C), along with complete information, appears on the right side of the window. On the right side of the window, users have access to several features that assist them in composing captions, including a checking table (Figure 1.E), GPT evaluation and expla- nation (Figure 1.F and 1.G), generated captions - long/short versions (Figure 1.H), and (4) referred paragraphs (Figure 1.I). Users are able to edit the caption in the caption editor (Figure 1.D) and resubmit it for re-evaluation. In the backend, once a user submits a pdf file, SciCapenter will store the file in our MongoDB and extract figures, captions, abstracts, and contents using pdffigure2 [7].1 The extracted figure list will then be presented in the navigation bar (Figure 1.B). Regular expressions are then used to identify the corresponding referred paragraphs (Figure 1.I) based on the figure index, similar to how Huang et al. extracted figure-mentioning paragraphs [19]. The check table (Figure 1.E) detects whether the written caption describes or expresses the following six aspects [18]:",

We ob- served that after participants viewed the six aspects reported in the check table (Figure 1.E), their writings were influenced, for example, to include takeaway messages and figures’ vi- sual features. To minimize this influence, we changed the task order by asking participants to proceed with the condi- tions without SciCapenter first in the formal study. We also included extra instructions clarifying that the six aspects are suggestions, not requirements. • In the pilot study, the rating’s explanation (Figure 1.G) was only visible when users hovered over a small button. We found that participants frequently ignored this explanation. As a result, we modified the interface to display the explana- tion directly. • The missing aspects in the check table (Figure 1.E) were originally tagged with the icon “X”. Users expressed concerns about such a strong rejection symbol. We, therefore, replaced it with a triangle alert symbol.",

To explore this, we recruited three professional aca- demic paper editors to assess the quality of captions generated by various models. From the SciCap Challenge dataset [17], we randomly selected 200 figure-caption pairs. For each figure, we generated two captions using models from SciCapenter (Summary Short and Summary Long), one caption using GPT-4V by prompting it with the figure image and figure-mentioning paragraphs, and we also included the original author-written caption (Ground Truth). To ensure a fair comparison in our study, GPT-4V was prompted to generate captions no longer than the author-written captions, acknowledg- ing that readers often favor longer captions. This length constraint aimed to minimize the influence of caption length on quality as- sessment. We recruited three professional editors (Expert 1, 2, and 3) through UpWork,5 all specializing in technical academic articles and native American English speakers. Their backgrounds include one with over ten years of editing experience and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and two from the STEM fields—one in Theoretical Astro- physics and another in Neuroscience—with extensive experience in editing, proofreading, and publishing academic papers. They ranked the captions based on their effectiveness in clarifying the figure’s intended message. The results are shown in Figure 4. Under the caption length constraints, GPT-4V did not outperform Sci- Capenter’s models drastically. Although Experts 1 and 2 preferred GPT-4V’s generation over that of SciCapenter’s models, Expert 3 did not favor it.",
